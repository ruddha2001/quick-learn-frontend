## Quick Learn - Frontend

Before we start, a couple of things we need to clear:

- This will NOT make you an expert frontend dev in one night.
- This will NOT teach you everything that is there to work with frontend.
- This will NOT spoon feed you every information. You will need to read and research and debug and do the leg work yourself.

Now that we got it past us, what this quick learn aims to achieve is:

- Get you started with frontend development.
- Inform you the various concepts, terminology and ideologies we use in frontend development.
- Start from ground and build to the top. We start from the bare basic concepts and go on to advanced concepts like state management.

There are some prerequisites to this quick learn:

- You need to know basics of JavaScript. If you are fumbling with the basics, it is suggested you go through [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps).
- You also need to be clear with conditionals, loops and functions in JavaScript. For that you can read [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks) up until 'Introduction to events'. We start this quick learn from 'Introduction to events' chapter.

### How it works

Every module has it's own `README.md` which has instructions and resources.
Every module also has a `solution` folder which contains the solution to the problems. Well you can always cheat, but if just copying code is your intention, why are we here in the first place?
