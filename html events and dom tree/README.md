## Theory Objectives

### DOM Tree

#### Read the following resources and answer the questions that follow:

- [https://javascript.info/dom-nodes](https://javascript.info/dom-nodes)

1. What is the root node of the DOM tree?
2. What are the elements of a DOM tree?
3. How many children nodes can an element have?

### HTML Events

#### Read the following resources and answer the questions that follow:

- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events)

1. Explain HTML Events in your own words.
2. Write a code snippet to add an onLoad event on the document which prints your name in the console. Use `addEventListener()`.
3. What does `event.preventDefault()` do?
4. Explain event bubbling in your own words.

## Practical Objectives

### Problem 1

Solve all of the following:

1. [https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/tasks/events/events1-download.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/tasks/events/events1-download.html)
2. [https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/tasks/events/events2-download.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/tasks/events/events2-download.html)
3. [https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/tasks/events/events3-download.html](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/building-blocks/tasks/events/events3-download.html)

### Problem 2

In `index.js`, finish the function `createNewNode()`. Required descriptions are given as function comments.
Comment each line of newly added code, explaining what that line is doing. For variable assignments, explain why you need it and how you want to use it in the code.

In the browser console, run `runTest()`. The output should be `ALL TEST CASES PASSED` for successful implementation.
